    evol_deepmind is the main function that initializes and trains a learner to switch between n drugs

    ...

    Args
    ------
    num_evols: int
        how many evolutionary time steps are allowed to occur in between actions? defaults to one
    N: int
        number of alleles on the fitness landscape - landscape size scales 2^N. defaults to 5
    sigma: float
        numeric value determing the degree of epistasis in the underlying landscapes
    episodes: int
        number of episodes to train over
    reset_every: int
        number of evolutionary steps per episode
    min_epsilon: float
        epsilon at which we will stop training. the epsilon_decay hyperparameter is automatically 
        modulated based on this parameter and the number of episodes you want to run
    train_input: string
        should we use the state vector (genotype), or the fitness vector (growth) to train the model?
        allowed values are 'state_vector' and 'fitness'
    random_start: bool
        Should the state vector be initialized (and re-initialized) with the population scattered across 
        the fitness landscape instead of concentrated in one place?
    noise: bool
        should we incorporate noise into the "sensor" readings that are fed into the learner
    num_drugs: int
        How many drugs should the agent have access to? defaults to 4
    normalize_drugs: bool
        should we normalize the landscapes that represent our drugs so that the 
        min value for fitness is 0 and the max is 1?
    drugs: list of arrays
        pre-specify landscapes for each drug option? if blank it will automatically compute them 
    mira: bool
        Should we use the E. Coli drug landscapes defined by Mira et al?
    player_wcutoff: float
        What fitness value should we use to define the player victory conditions?
    pop_wcutoff: float
        what fitness value should we use to define the population victory conditions?
    win_threshold: int
        how many consecutive actions does fitness need to remain beyond the 
        victory cutoff before the game is called?
    win_reward: float
        how much reward should be awarded or penalized based on the outcome of a given ep
    standard_practice: bool
        should the comparison group mimic the current standard practice? i.e. 
        should the comparison group give a random drug until fitness approaches 
        some maximum and then randomly switch to another available drug?
